# Predicting Candidates' Success

While the ideal job position is a two-way street in which the candidate wants the company and the company wants the candidate, ultimately, the company wants to know how you will perform and help it improve its overall performance. One way to do this is to use AI tools that can predict the success you may have in the role and how you conduct yourself. The following subsections describe exactly what this is and how it works.

## Personality and Trait Assessments

One way that recruiters may predict candidates' success in a role is by better understanding their personality traits. Recruiters can now leverage AI tools to assess these personality traits. Ultimately, they want to know how you may interact with other people and what you may do in various situations.

### Zelfium

[Zelfium](https://www.zelfium.com/#/) distills 300+ scientifically verified personality factors into 7 major traits, 14 sub-traits, and 36 components using machine learning, particularly neural deep networks. Zelfium's innovation lies in its use of AI to analyze user responses and behaviors, resulting in a highly accurate personality profile. This dynamic process continuously refines results, offering a comprehensive understanding of human personalities worldwide.

## Predictive Models for Roles

Organizations can leverage their historical data to build predictive models for specific roles, which are often trained by AI algorithms that pull from previous or current employees at the company who have been successful. This can then be used in assessing potential candidates in the future.

## Behavior Analysis

Similar to personality and trait assessments, companies may use AI tools to predict the behavior of candidates in a working environment and how that may impact their ability to succeed in a specific role.

It quickly uncovers an individual's natural behavioral drives and needs, helping predict their actions in various situations. By answering two questions about expected work behavior and self-perceived behavior, participants are assigned one of 17 Reference Profiles, offering insights into their innate tendencies. The assessment measures four key behavioral drives: dominance, which influences control; extroversion, driving social interaction; patience, seeking stability; and formality, promoting rule conformity. This tool empowers organizations to make informed hiring and team-building decisions, enhancing workplace dynamics and performance.
