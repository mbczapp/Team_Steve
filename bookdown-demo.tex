\chapter{Introduction to Our Book}\label{introduction-to-our-book}}

For students at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, the primary goal by graduation is to have a full-time job offer at a company and location that makes them excited to start their professional careers. Throughout the fall and winter semesters, recruiting is an incredibly time-consuming and stressful process, so students must use their time and effort efficiently to maximize their job opportunities. However, the recent and rapid progression of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has reshaped the recruiting landscape. Therefore, students need to understand how they can use these tools to their advantage and how recruiters may be using AI throughout the recruitment process.

Our book will provide a comprehensive overview of these AI tools. We will approach this from two perspectives: students' and recruiters'. For students, we discuss how they can use AI job finders, resume and cover letter optimization, practice interviews, and automated applications to support their professional endeavors. On the other hand, we discuss what AI tools recruiters may use, like applicant tracking systems (ATS), resume and cover letter screening, interview assessments, skill assessments, and predictive analytics. Then, we suggest how students should tailor their presentation of themselves to fit what these AI tools look for.

\includegraphics[width=4.04167in,height=\textheight]{Team Photo.jpg}

Our team, \textbf{Team Steve}, is driven by Steve's desire for a website that describes how new AI Tools are used in the recruitment process. For context, Steve (as seen in the black O'Neill shirt in the front left) is a student here at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business who is NOT in our project team. When deciding our team name, we thought it'd be a great idea to name it after the first person we encounter. We happened to run into Steve outside of our classroom, and the rest is history.

Hello! My name is Xinqian (Demi) Dai, and I come from the beautiful province of Heilongjiang, China, where I was born and raised. In 2019, I embarked on my exciting journey by enrolling at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for my undergraduate studies. I graduated with a double major in Marketing and Statistics in May 2023. My interest in Marketing has deep roots that extend back to my childhood days when I found myself more fascinated by the commercial inserts of a washing powder than the animated series on TV.~ Currently, I am intrigued by Customer Analytics, Advertising Effectiveness, and Digital Marketing, and I'm eager to delve deeper into these areas. Looking ahead, my post-graduation aspirations involve entering into the MarTech (Marketing Technology) industry. Armed with the knowledge and skills from the MBAn program, I aim to make a significant impact by applying data-driven strategies and innovative marketing technologies.

During my time at UMass Amherst, I engaged in a diverse range of research experiences and marketing projects. As a Marketing Research Assistant at the UMass Ombuds Office, I analyzed data from over 300 undergraduate student visitors, studying variables like gender and major to identify successful conflict resolution strategies. Utilizing R and Python, I applied regression models to estimate meeting times and understand the impact of visitor demographics on appointment durations. During my participation in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program, I conducted full-time research on Bayesian parameter estimations, highlighting the effectiveness of Bayesian models over traditional linear regression models. Additionally, as a Research Assistant in the UMass Marketing Department, I analyzed customer reactions to visual advertisements for various product categories and conducted experiments to evaluate the effect of different headbands on students. As a Strategist for the UMass AdLab, I designed customized questionnaires and implemented successful advertising strategies, resulting in a significant increase in orders for local companies. These experiences have shaped my passion for business analytics and my dedication to data-driven research and strategic planning.

\chapter{What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?}\label{what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai}}

Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision (1).

The functioning of AI involves the processing of extensive labeled training data, identifying correlations and patterns within the data, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. For instance, a chatbot can learn to produce lifelike conversations with people after being trained on text examples, while an image recognition tool can accurately identify and describe objects in images through the analysis of millions of examples. Generative AI techniques have also shown significant progress in generating realistic text, images, music, and other media.

AI programming revolves around cognitive skills that encompass:

\textbf{1. Learning}: The acquisition of data and creation of algorithms that convert it into actionable information, providing step-by-step instructions for specific tasks to computing devices.

\textbf{2. Reasoning:} The selection of appropriate algorithms to achieve desired outcomes.

\textbf{3. Self-correction:} Continuously refining algorithms to ensure optimal and precise results.

\textbf{4. Creativity:} Utilizing neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods, and other AI techniques to generate novel images, text, music, and ideas.

The significance of artificial intelligence lies in its potential to revolutionize how we live, work, and engage in leisure activities. AI has found effective applications in automating tasks traditionally performed by humans, such as customer service, lead generation, fraud detection, and quality control. Particularly in repetitive and detail-oriented tasks, AI often outperforms humans in terms of speed and accuracy, as demonstrated in analyzing vast numbers of legal documents for accurate field completion. The processing capabilities of AI enable enterprises to gain valuable insights into their operations that were previously inaccessible.

The proliferation of AI tools, especially generative AI, promises transformative impacts across various domains, including education, marketing, and product design. Leading companies like Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta have integrated AI technologies to enhance their operations and maintain a competitive edge. For instance, Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, employs AI at the core of its search engine, Waymo's self-driving cars, and Google Brain, the pioneer behind the transformer neural network architecture that drives recent advancements in natural language processing.

Overall, the advent of AI not only drives efficiency improvements but also creates unprecedented business opportunities, as evidenced by Uber's success in leveraging computer software to connect riders with taxis and becoming a Fortune 500 company. The ongoing progress in AI holds the potential to shape a dynamic and transformative future across various industries.
