**Background**

My name is Michael Czapp, and I am currently a Master of Business Analytics (MBAn) student at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. In April 2023, I graduated from the College of Engineering here with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial & Operations Engineering. I knew I wanted to specialize in analytics, so starting a graduate program right after graduation made the most sense. It also allowed me to have an extra year at the University of Michigan and stay in my home state, and I plan to make the most of it!

**Experience**

**Fun Facts**

-   Both my older brother and sister studied industrial engineering in undergrad

-   I can play hockey as both a goalie and a skater
