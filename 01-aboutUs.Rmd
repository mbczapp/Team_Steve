**Background**

My name is Michael Czapp, and I am currently a Master of Business Analytics (MBAn) student at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. In April 2023, I graduated from the College of Engineering here with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial & Operations Engineering. I knew I wanted to specialize in analytics, so starting a graduate program right after graduation made the most sense. It also allowed me to have an extra year at the University of Michigan and stay in my home state, and I plan to make the most of it!

**Background**

I was born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq, but now I live in the metro Detroit area. Besides my regular job, I love doing photography as a hobby. I enjoy capturing moments and emotions with my camera, and it lets me see the world in a whole new way. Additionally, I have a knack for analytics; I enjoy working with data, finding patterns, and gaining valuable insights from it. This analytical mindset helps me both in my photography and other aspects of life.
