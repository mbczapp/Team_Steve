</h2>
<p>Only 4/5 of our team members completed the mid-point check-in survey, but we obtained the remaining team member’s feedback at a later date. The majority of the anonymous feedback was very positive. There was a 1 out of 5 rating for "Listening" but this was just a mistake one team member made when filling out their survey. Every category was ranked at least a 3 out of 5, with a majority of them being a 4 or 5. It seemed everybody has happy with the direction of our team and project outputs so far. </p>
<p><strong>What is one thing we have been doing really well as a team?</strong></p>
<p>Our responses to this question were underscored by the following themes: time management and supportiveness. Whenever we met as a team, the meetings were always productive and everybody had a clear idea of what the purpose of the meeting was and what work we should be completing inbetween meetings.</p>
<p><strong>What is one thing we should do differently as a team moving forward?</strong></p>
<p>There were a few areas for improvement that team members highlighted. These were increasing our communication during the last few weeks of the semester as there was a lot of work due and conducting performance reviews for improvement and getting feedback. We tried to improve upon these things after we received the survey results, and we were mostly satisfied with the results.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">15.2</span> Meeting Strategy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#meeting-strategy"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Our meeting strategy for the project was designed to optimize our collaboration and ensure consistent progress toward our goals. We structured our meetings to provide a balanced blend of virtual and in-person interactions. By meeting 2-3 times a week, we ensured consistent communication and alignment among team members. Our Zoom meetings serve as dynamic platforms for discussing coding strategies, brainstorming solutions, and addressing technical challenges. In contrast, our in-person meetings are dedicated to refining our presentation materials, enhancing our communication skills, and polishing our project deliverables. Additionally, our regular check-in meetings provided opportunities for quick updates, progress tracking, and issue resolution, further fostering a efficient teamwork environment.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">15.3</span> Communication Strategy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#communication-strategy"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Our team followed a seamless and efficient communication strategy. We chose GroupMe as our primary platform for active communication, ensuring instant updates, quick clarifications, and the ability to share important announcements. In addition, we utilized email threads to coordinate and schedule study room sessions, enabling us to optimize our study and work sessions effectively. Our shared Google Doc served as a centralized hub for managing all project content, allowing us to collaboratively contribute, edit, and organize our work. The feature of adding comments on each others’ work within the shared Google Doc ensured constructive feedback and promoted a culture of continuous improvement among our team members.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">15.4</span> Navigating Conflict<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#navigating-conflict"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Our group truly showed the essence of teamwork. Whenever we encountered obstacles that left us in a bind, our collective response was to regroup, huddle up, and carefully reconsider our approach. The synergy within our team was such that conflicts hardly arose; however, even in those rare instances, our ability to swiftly reconcile differences was impressive. This collaboration and quick conflict resolution not only kept us on track but also nurtured an environment where collaboration and psychological safety thrived. Our shared commitment to open communication and mutual respect allowed us to navigate challenges with a common goal and allowed us to view the bigger picture, ultimately leading to a great number of successful outcomes. We also dedicated time after presentations and submitting project deliverables to reflect on our success and areas for improvement. This commitment to honesty also helped us mitigate and minimize conflict.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">15.5</span> Managing Bookdown and GitHub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#managing-bookdown-and-github"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Going into this project, none of us had any significant experience with GitHub nor Bookdown. However, a few members of our team had prior experience with R and RStudio. Michael invested time early in the project to set up the GitHub repository and the GitHub Pages website. Team members individually set up their RStudio and downloaded the required packages and installs to be able to push and pull to GitHub. We had a few impromptu meetings to ensure everybody's technology was working smoothly and there were no significant issues. During this troubleshooting stage, we relied on each other and Google to gather information and knowledge to debug issues we ran into. Additionally, we also documented the steps and procedures to properly commit, push, pull, and build the book. Overall, while we came into this project with minimal experience in this area, our commitment to learning and using each other as a resource proved to be invaluable to our ability to build a respectable website.</p>

<div id="how-we-were-agile" class="section level2" number="15.6">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">15.6</span> How We Were Agile<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-we-were-agile"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Our team embraced the Agile methodology as the basis of our working process. As the Agile Manifesto highlights, we value "Responding to chage over following a plan."  We broke our project into small sections and focused on specific sections at a time, building upon them and working in increments. </p>
<p>We also valued "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools'' mentioned in the Agile Manifesto. Our team had excellent collaboration, where team members help each other when challenges arise, work together on tasks and overcome challenges, and leverage each member's expertise.</p>
<p>In addition, we translated Agile's "Working solutions over comprehensive documentation" into our team approach to meetings and communication. We held a mix of in-person and virtual meetings based on the amount of meeting preparation work and the type of work to be done in the meetings to maximize working productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>By efficiently and successfully breaking work into increments, embracing collaboration, and adapting various communication methods, we built a team environment that strongly aligned wth the Agile Manifesto's values, which helped us achieve project success.</p>
<p>Additionally, we ensured everybody had a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities, and we made sure everyone else was aware of each others’ responsibilities too. For example, we had a Google Doc that we used to build and craft the majority of our content for the website. We delegated sections of the website to be completed by each team member, and we carefully tracked and monitored everybody's status as seen below. This helped our team adapt to change and assist other team members very easily and efficiently when those moments arose.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">15.7</span> Fostering Psychological Safety<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fostering-psychological-safety"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Over the summer, our team’s cohesion has been underscored by a deep-rooted psychological safety. From the outset, we prioritized an environment of trust and open communication, ensuring that every member felt both comfortable and empowered. This was not just evidenced in the absence of concerns regarding comfort, but also in the equal weight given to each voice and idea. Whether voicing differing opinions, addressing concerns, or delivering challenging news, the team always met each other with understanding rather than judgment. It’s worth noting that our team culture was not one of mere tolerance, but active acceptance. Mistakes, instead of becoming points of contention, were treated as opportunities for growth. Every team member could confidently rely on their peers for help, knowing well that their efforts would never be intentionally sabotaged. For example, Demi was very open to helping out other team members complete their sections as she had completed her individual section work pretty quickly. Furthermore, what truly set our group apart was the recognition and harnessing of individual strengths. Each person’s unique talents and skills were celebrated and utilized, elevating the overall quality of our collaborative projects.</p>
