\chapter{Introduction to Our Book}\label{introduction-to-our-book}}

For students at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, the primary goal by graduation is to have a full-time job offer at a company and location that makes them excited to start their professional careers. Throughout the fall and winter semesters, recruiting is an incredibly time-consuming and stressful process, so students must use their time and effort efficiently to maximize their job opportunities. However, the recent and rapid progression of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has reshaped the recruiting landscape. Therefore, students need to understand how they can use these tools to their advantage and how recruiters may be using AI throughout the recruitment process.

Our book will provide a comprehensive overview of these AI tools. We will approach this from two perspectives: students' and recruiters'. For students, we discuss how they can use AI job finders, resume and cover letter optimization, practice interviews, and automated applications to support their professional endeavors. On the other hand, we discuss what AI tools recruiters may use, like applicant tracking systems (ATS), resume and cover letter screening, interview assessments, skill assessments, and predictive analytics. Then, we suggest how students should tailor their presentation of themselves to fit what these AI tools are looking for.

\textbf{Students looking for AI tools to help their application and interview process should see Chapters 4 - 7}

\textbf{Students looking for a better understanding of how recruiters use AI tools should see Chapters 8 - 13}

Our team, \textbf{Team Steve}, is driven by Steve's desire for a website that describes how new AI Tools are used in the recruitment process. For context, Steve (as seen in the black O'Neill shirt in the front left) is a student here at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business who is NOT in our project team. When deciding our team name, we thought it'd be a great idea to name it after the first person we encounter. We happened to run into Steve outside of our classroom, and the rest is history.

\chapter{What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?}\label{what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai}}

Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision (1).

The functioning of AI involves the processing of extensive labeled training data, identifying correlations and patterns within the data, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. For instance, a chatbot can learn to produce lifelike conversations with people after being trained on text examples, while an image recognition tool can accurately identify and describe objects in images through the analysis of millions of examples. Generative AI techniques have also shown significant progress in generating realistic text, images, music, and other media.

AI programming revolves around cognitive skills that include:

\textbf{1. Learning:} The acquisition of data and creation of algorithms that convert data into actionable information, providing step-by-step instructions for specific tasks to computing devices.

\textbf{2. Reasoning:} The selection of appropriate algorithms to achieve desired outcomes.

\textbf{3. Self-correction:} Continuously refining algorithms to ensure optimal and precise results.

\textbf{4. Creativity:} Utilizing neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods, and other techniques to generate images, text, music, and ideas.

Artificial intelligence\textquotesingle s signficance lies in its potential to revolutionize how we live, work, and engage in our lives. AI has applications in automating tasks traditionally performed by humans, particularly in repetitive and detail-oriented tasks. The processing capabilities of AI enable enterprises to gain valuable insights into their operations that were inaccessible previously.

The growth of AI tools, especially generative AI, promises transformative impacts across domains like education, marketing, and product design. Leading companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta have integrated AI technologies to enhance their operations and maintain a competitive edge. For example, Google employs AI at the core of its search engine, in Waymo\textquotesingle s self-driving cars, and in Google Brain, the leader behind the transformer neural network architecture that drives recent advancements in natural language processing.

Overall, the rapid growth of AI not only drives efficiency improvements but also creates unprecedented business opportunities, as evidenced by Uber\textquotesingle s success in leveraging computer software to connect riders with taxis and becoming a Fortune 500 company. The ongoing progress in AI holds the potential to shape a dynamic and transformative future across all kinds of industries.

\section{What You (A Student) Can Do!}\label{what-you-a-student-can-do}}

For a student to successfully navigate and benefit from recruiting chatbots during their job search, they should consider the following strategies:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Familiarize with the common platforms and tools and algorithms} that companies use. This knowledge can help anticipate what to expect and how to interact with recruiting chatbots.
\item
  When interacting with chatbots, \textbf{use clear language and be specific in your queries}. Avoid slang, abbreviations, or overly complex vocabulary since chatbots operate best with straightforward information.
\item
  Chatbots are programmed to screen candidates based on predefined criteria. Anticipate and \textbf{prepare for standard questions} related to qualifications, experience, and job preferences.
\item
  Make sure your \textbf{resume or online profile highlights your main qualifications, skills, and achievements} in a clear and organized manner. This helps the chatbot easily identify and match your profile with suitable roles.
\item
  Given the 24/7 availability of chatbots, take advantage of this by \textbf{actively engaging with them}, asking questions, and seeking information about job roles, company culture, or application processes.
\item
  If you feel the chatbot isn't adequately addressing your concerns or if you have specific questions, \textbf{ask for human intervention or look for alternative communication channels}.
\item
  While engaging with chatbots, \textbf{be wary of sharing overly personal or sensitive information} unless you're sure of the platform's privacy standards.
\item
  Some advanced chatbots offer the option to \textbf{provide feedback}. Utilize this to clarify misunderstandings or to improve future interactions.
\item
  While chatbots are a valuable tool, \textbf{don't rely solely on them}. Use additional resources, such as career counselors, networking events, and traditional job platforms to complement your job search.

\chapter{Resume and Cover Letter Screening}\label{resume-and-cover-letter-screening}}

With the rise of AI tools and an increasing number of people graduating from college, job openings are experiencing large numbers of applicants. This is especially true for established companies that students want to work at because of their large societal impact and safer job security. For example, popular tech companies like Google, Apple, and Amazon and consulting firms like Deloitte, McKinsey \& Company, PwC, and EY have applicants from hundreds of colleges and universities and across the entire United States. To speed up the recruitment process, companies like these often use resume and cover letter screeners early on in their candidate selection process, so this chapter discusses how they use those tools and what students can do to better their chances.

\section{What You (A Student) Can Do!}\label{what-you-a-student-can-do-1}}

Understanding what tools recruiters use to filter our candidates is the first step. By understanding the most popular tools, a few of which are referenced above, you can try to adjust your resume and cover letters to match what these tools search for and filter on. There are additional \href{https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/resume-ai\#:~:text=Instead\%20of\%20using\%20a\%20visual,this\%20kind\%20of\%20complex\%20information.}{recommended best practices} you can follow to ensure this step of the recruitment process is not where you fall out of the race with the company of your dreams:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Triple check (or even quadruple check!) that there are \textbf{no typos or mispelled words}. It's much easier for an AI tool to discover these errors than a human
\item
  Use a \textbf{traditional, standard, and clean} resume format
\item
  Make sure to \textbf{submit the correct file type} for your resume (usually specified in the job application) as some AI tools can only process certain file types
\item
  Avoid using a visual resume, especially for technical roles. Opt for \textbf{plain text and relatively basic formatting}
\item
  Make a thorough attempt to \textbf{add keywords} to your resume that were mentioned in the job posting as the AI tool will look for these
\item
  Include a \textbf{mix of hard and soft skills} to showcase your diverse skill set
\item
  \textbf{Traditional or usual resume advice still applies} to the resumes you submit to be analyzed by AI tools
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{video-interview-assessments}{%
\chapter{Video Interview Assessments}\label{video-interview-assessments}}

One way that recruiters may also quicken the recruitment process is to use AI tools that analyze video interviews, whether self-recorded by the candidate or from an actual interview with employees from the company. More commonly, though, the video interview assessment that an AI conducts will be through a self-recorded interview the candidate will record on the employer's hiring platform. \textbf{Watch the following video for a concise summary of how AI can be used in the interview process!}

\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJkHft032OE}{The AI Video Interview}

\hypertarget{how-it-works}{%
\section{How it Works}\label{how-it-works}}

It's important to note that the extent or amount of influence an AI tool will have will vary on the company. One company may not use AI tools at all to analyze a recorded interview video, whereas another company may use AI as a supplemental analysis to support decision making or just rely entirely on AI to filter out candidates.

In general, a video interview assessment entails a question being shown to the candidate, and then a brief period, usually around 30 seconds, for the candidate to prepare and formulate a response. Then, the tool will record the candidate's response (video and audio) for the allotted time for that question, which is usually just a few minutes. There may be an option to redo the video one time without a penalty, but don't rely on it as that is not always an option. Afterwards, the AI tool will create a report based on two main elements: \textbf{facial analysis} and \textbf{language analysis} (1).~

\hypertarget{facial-analysis}{%
\subsection{Facial Analysis}\label{facial-analysis}}

Facial analysis will focus on the non-verbal aspect of the interview or how you conduct yourself during the recordings. This may include things such as \textbf{eye contact} with the camera, \textbf{eye wandering}, \textbf{lip position} and \textbf{movements}, \textbf{eyebrow movements} (furrowing and raising), \textbf{amount of smiling}, \textbf{chin raising}, and more (2).

\includegraphics[width=3.46875in,height=\textheight]{Facial_Analysis.png}

\hypertarget{language-analysis}{%
\subsection{Language Analysis}\label{language-analysis}}

On the other hand, language analysis will focus on the content of your responses and the nature of your delivery. During or immediately after the recorded interview, the AI tool will convert your responses to text. Then, it'll parse through this and look for various things. From a content perspective, this may include the \textbf{technical language} and \textbf{vocabulary} you use that aligns with the job description and what the company is looking for (1). From a delivery perspective, this may include \textbf{active vs passive voice}, \textbf{run-on sentences}, the use of \textbf{filler words}, and the \textbf{tone} of your voice.

\includegraphics[width=2.16667in,height=\textheight]{Language_Analysis.png}

\hypertarget{benefits-1}{%
\section{Benefits}\label{benefits-1}}

AI-assessed interviews provide numerous benefits for both the recruiter and candidate:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Recruiters}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Allows the company to accept more applicants to the open position~
  \item
    Spend less money on employees to assess the video recordings
  \item
    Removes the bottleneck of screening the recordings by hand
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Candidates}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    While there is always a deadline, you can choose to do the recorded interview when it works best in your schedule
  \item
    More fair hiring process that isn't influenced as much by preconceptions and human biases and instead focuses more on qualifications
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{drawbacks}{%
\section{Drawbacks}\label{drawbacks}}

While AI-assessed interviews have its benefits, there are some significant drawbacks:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  AI tools must be coded by humans in the first place, so there is no guarantee that the tool will be free of human biases
\item
  They may reinforce discriminatory practices such as penalizing someone with a strong accent or speed impediment
\item
  Human emotions and facial expressions are very complex and may not be interpreted correctly, which can inadvertently remove a qualified candidate from the selection process
\item
  Concerns regarding personal privacy and data security due to the large amounts of information being collected during the recordings
\end{itemize}

As a student preparing for the recruiting process this upcoming school year, you may be wondering how you can best set yourself up for success if you ever experience one of these AI interviews. \textbf{Look no further!} The following subsections highlight some tips and best practices.

\hypertarget{general-preparation}{%
\subsection{General Preparation}\label{general-preparation}}

General preparation relates to activities and preparation work you should be doing prior to the interview to ensure you're best prepared to answer the questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Research the company and general job type thoroughly in case of any questions related to why you want to work for the company or why you are applying to that positions
\item
  Prepare what you are going to say. Research some \href{https://www.themuse.com/advice/interview-questions-and-answers}{commonly asked interview questions} and make sure you have a story bank of your past experiences that you can pull from and adjust based on the question asked
\item
  Practice using the \href{https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method}{STAR (situation, task, action, result) method} as it's very popular framework for providing a response that is coherent, comprehensive, and insightful
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{countering-the-ai-tools}{%
\subsection{Countering the AI Tools}\label{countering-the-ai-tools}}

Countering the AI tools relates to what you should do during the interview based on what the AI tools are looking for and analyzing.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Practice talking to a camera and recording yourself} so you get a good feel for where you're at and how to make progress (see Chapter 6: Student Practice Interviews)
\item
  \textbf{Dress nice} as if you were being interviewed by an actual interviewer in person
\item
  \textbf{Clean the background of your recording space} so the AI tool doesn't penalize you for a distracting background or make it harder for it to more accurately read your facial expressions
\item
  Ensure your \textbf{lighting is good} to allow for a proper facial analysis by the AI
\item
  Try to \textbf{maintain eye contact with the camera} as much as possible and use sticky notes on the computer/laptop if you want to refer to material
\item
  Keep your \textbf{head high or at a neutral position}; avoid angling your head downward
\item
  \textbf{Smile} and maintain a happy facial expression
\item
  \textbf{Avoid} the use of filler words like \textbf{``um'', ``like'', or ``hmm''}
\item
  Use \textbf{keywords} (skills and job duties) from the job description during your responses if you can
\item
  \textbf{Speak clearly and loudly} (more than usual) to ensure the AI tool can translate your verbal response into text
\item
  \textbf{Try not to furrow your eyebrow}s as it can be interpreted as confusion, disapproval, or worry
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{skill-assessments}{%
\chapter{Skill Assessments}\label{skill-assessments}}

\hypertarget{mid-point-check-in-survey}{%
\section{Mid-Point Check-In Survey}\label{mid-point-check-in-survey}}

Only 4/5 of our team members completed the mid-point check-in survey, but we obtained the remaining team member's feedback at a later date. The majority of the anonymous feedback was very positive. There was a 1 out of 5 rating for ``Listening'' but this was just a mistake one team member made when filling out their survey. Every category was ranked at least a 3 out of 5, with a majority of them being a 4 or 5. It seemed everybody has happy with the direction of our team and project outputs so far.~

\textbf{What is one thing we have been doing really well as a team?}

Our responses to this question were underscored by the following themes: time management and supportiveness. Whenever we met as a team, the meetings were always productive and everybody had a clear idea of what the purpose of the meeting was and what work we should be completing inbetween meetings.

\textbf{What is one thing we should do differently as a team moving forward?}

There were a few areas for improvement that team members highlighted. These were increasing our communication during the last few weeks of the semester as there was a lot of work due and conducting performance reviews for improvement and getting feedback. We tried to improve upon these things after we received the survey results, and we were mostly satisfied with the results.

\hypertarget{meeting-strategy}{%
\section{Meeting Strategy}\label{meeting-strategy}}

Our meeting strategy for the project was designed to optimize our collaboration and ensure consistent progress toward our goals. We structured our meetings to provide a balanced blend of virtual and in-person interactions. By meeting 2-3 times a week, we ensured consistent communication and alignment among team members. Our Zoom meetings serve as dynamic platforms for discussing coding strategies, brainstorming solutions, and addressing technical challenges. In contrast, our in-person meetings are dedicated to refining our presentation materials, enhancing our communication skills, and polishing our project deliverables. Additionally, our regular check-in meetings provided opportunities for quick updates, progress tracking, and issue resolution, further fostering a efficient teamwork environment.

\hypertarget{communication-strategy}{%
\section{Communication Strategy}\label{communication-strategy}}

Our team followed a seamless and efficient communication strategy. We chose GroupMe as our primary platform for active communication, ensuring instant updates, quick clarifications, and the ability to share important announcements. In addition, we utilized email threads to coordinate and schedule study room sessions, enabling us to optimize our study and work sessions effectively. Our shared Google Doc served as a centralized hub for managing all project content, allowing us to collaboratively contribute, edit, and organize our work. The feature of adding comments on each others' work within the shared Google Doc ensured constructive feedback and promoted a culture of continuous improvement among our team members.

\hypertarget{navigating-conflict}{%
\section{Navigating Conflict}\label{navigating-conflict}}

Our group truly showed the essence of teamwork. Whenever we encountered obstacles that left us in a bind, our collective response was to regroup, huddle up, and carefully reconsider our approach. The synergy within our team was such that conflicts hardly arose; however, even in those rare instances, our ability to swiftly reconcile differences was impressive. This collaboration and quick conflict resolution not only kept us on track but also nurtured an environment where collaboration and psychological safety thrived. Our shared commitment to open communication and mutual respect allowed us to navigate challenges with a common goal and allowed us to view the bigger picture, ultimately leading to a great number of successful outcomes. We also dedicated time after presentations and submitting project deliverables to reflect on our success and areas for improvement. This commitment to honesty also helped us mitigate and minimize conflict.

\hypertarget{managing-bookdown-and-github}{%
\section{Managing Bookdown and GitHub}\label{managing-bookdown-and-github}}

Going into this project, none of us had any significant experience with GitHub nor Bookdown. However, a few members of our team had prior experience with R and RStudio. Michael invested time early in the project to set up the GitHub repository and the GitHub Pages website. Team members individually set up their RStudio and downloaded the required packages and installs to be able to push and pull to GitHub. We had a few impromptu meetings to ensure everybody's technology was working smoothly and there were no significant issues. During this troubleshooting stage, we relied on each other and Google to gather information and knowledge to debug issues we ran into. Additionally, we also documented the steps and procedures to properly commit, push, pull, and build the book. Overall, while we came into this project with minimal experience in this area, our commitment to learning and using each other as a resource proved to be invaluable to our ability to build a respectable website.

\hypertarget{how-we-were-agile}{%
\section{How We Were Agile}\label{how-we-were-agile}}

Our team embraced the Agile methodology as the basis of our working process. As the Agile Manifesto highlights, we value ``Responding to chage over following a plan.''~ We broke our project into small sections and focused on specific sections at a time, building upon them and working in increments.~

We also valued ``Individuals and interactions over processes and tools'\,' mentioned in the Agile Manifesto. Our team had excellent collaboration, where team members help each other when challenges arise, work together on tasks and overcome challenges, and leverage each member's expertise.

In addition, we translated Agile's ``Working solutions over comprehensive documentation'' into our team approach to meetings and communication. We held a mix of in-person and virtual meetings based on the amount of meeting preparation work and the type of work to be done in the meetings to maximize working productivity and efficiency.

By efficiently and successfully breaking work into increments, embracing collaboration, and adapting various communication methods, we built a team environment that strongly aligned wth the Agile Manifesto's values, which helped us achieve project success.

Additionally, we ensured everybody had a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities, and we made sure everyone else was aware of each others' responsibilities too. For example, we had a Google Doc that we used to build and craft the majority of our content for the website. We delegated sections of the website to be completed by each team member, and we carefully tracked and monitored everybody's status as seen below. This helped our team adapt to change and assist other team members very easily and efficiently when those moments arose.

\hypertarget{fostering-psychological-safety}{%
\section{Fostering Psychological Safety}\label{fostering-psychological-safety}}

Over the summer, our team's cohesion has been underscored by a deep-rooted psychological safety. From the outset, we prioritized an environment of trust and open communication, ensuring that every member felt both comfortable and empowered. This was not just evidenced in the absence of concerns regarding comfort, but also in the equal weight given to each voice and idea. Whether voicing differing opinions, addressing concerns, or delivering challenging news, the team always met each other with understanding rather than judgment. It's worth noting that our team culture was not one of mere tolerance, but active acceptance. Mistakes, instead of becoming points of contention, were treated as opportunities for growth. Every team member could confidently rely on their peers for help, knowing well that their efforts would never be intentionally sabotaged. For example, Demi was very open to helping out other team members complete their sections as she had completed her individual section work pretty quickly. Furthermore, what truly set our group apart was the recognition and harnessing of individual strengths. Each person's unique talents and skills were celebrated and utilized, elevating the overall quality of our collaborative projects.
