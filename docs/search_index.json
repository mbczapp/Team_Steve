Ross School of Business, the primary goal by graduation is to have a full-time job offer at a company and location that makes them excited to start their professional careers. Throughout the fall and winter semesters, recruiting is an incredibly time-consuming and stressful process, so students must use their time and effort efficiently to maximize their job opportunities. However, the recent and rapid progression of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has reshaped the recruiting landscape. Therefore, students need to understand how they can use these tools to their advantage and how recruiters may be using AI throughout the recruitment process. Our book will provide a comprehensive overview of these AI tools. We will approach this from two perspectives: students’ and recruiters’. For students, we discuss how they can use AI job finders, resume and cover letter optimization, practice interviews, and automated applications to support their professional endeavors. On the other hand, we discuss what AI tools recruiters may use, like applicant tracking systems (ATS), resume and cover letter screening, interview assessments, skill assessments, and predictive analytics. Then, we suggest how students should tailor their presentation of themselves to fit what these AI tools are looking for.

Creativity: Utilizing neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods, and other AI techniques to generate novel images, text, music, and ideas. The significance of artificial intelligence lies in its potential to revolutionize how we live, work, and engage in leisure activities. AI has found effective applications in automating tasks traditionally performed by humans, such as customer service, lead generation, fraud detection, and quality control. Particularly in repetitive and detail-oriented tasks, AI often outperforms humans in terms of speed and accuracy, as demonstrated in analyzing vast numbers of legal documents for accurate field completion. The processing capabilities of AI enable enterprises to gain valuable insights into their operations that were previously inaccessible. The proliferation of AI tools, especially generative AI, promises transformative impacts across various domains, including education, marketing, and product design. Leading companies like Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta have integrated AI technologies to enhance their operations and maintain a competitive edge. For instance, Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, employs AI at the core of its search engine, Waymo’s self-driving cars, and Google Brain, the pioneer behind the transformer neural network architecture that drives recent advancements in natural language processing. Overall, the advent of AI not only drives efficiency improvements but also creates unprecedented business opportunities, as evidenced by Uber’s success in leveraging computer software to connect riders with taxis and becoming a Fortune 500 company. The ongoing progress in AI holds the potential to shape a dynamic and transformative future across various industries.

For a student to successfully navigate and benefit from recruiting chatbots during their job search, they should consider the following strategies: Familiarize with the common platforms and tools and algorithms that companies use. This knowledge can help anticipate what to expect and how to interact with recruiting chatbots. When interacting with chatbots, use clear language and be specific in your queries. Avoid slang, abbreviations, or overly complex vocabulary since chatbots operate best with straightforward information. Chatbots are programmed to screen candidates based on predefined criteria. Anticipate and prepare for standard questions related to qualifications, experience, and job preferences. Make sure your resume or online profile highlights your main qualifications, skills, and achievements in a clear and organized manner. This helps the chatbot easily identify and match your profile with suitable roles. Given the 24/7 availability of chatbots, take advantage of this by actively engaging with them, asking questions, and seeking information about job roles, company culture, or application processes. If you feel the chatbot isn’t adequately addressing your concerns or if you have specific questions, ask for human intervention or look for alternative communication channels. While engaging with chatbots, be wary of sharing overly personal or sensitive information unless you’re sure of the platform’s privacy standards. Some advanced chatbots offer the option to provide feedback. Utilize this to clarify misunderstandings or to improve future interactions. While chatbots are a valuable tool, don’t rely solely on them. Use additional resources, such as career counselors, networking events, and traditional job platforms to complement your job search.

Opt for plain text and relatively basic formatting Make a thorough attempt to add keywords to your resume that were mentioned in the job posting as the AI tool will look for these Include a mix of hard and soft skills to showcase your diverse skill set Traditional or usual resume advice still applies to the resumes you submit to be analyzed by AI tools "],["video-interview-assessments.html", "Chapter 11 Video Interview Assessments 11.1 How it Works 11.2 Benefits 11.3 Drawbacks 11.4 What You (A Student) Can Do!", " Chapter 11 Video Interview Assessments One way that recruiters may also quicken the recruitment process is to use AI tools that analyze video interviews, whether self-recorded by the candidate or from an actual interview with employees from the company. More commonly, though, the video interview assessment that an AI conducts will be through a self-recorded interview the candidate will record on the employer’s hiring platform. Watch the following video for a concise summary of how AI can be used in the interview process! The AI Video Interview 11.1 How it Works It’s important to note that the extent or amount of influence an AI tool will have will vary on the company. One company may not use AI tools at all to analyze a recorded interview video, whereas another company may use AI as a supplemental analysis to support decision making or just rely entirely on AI to filter out candidates. In general, a video interview assessment entails a question being shown to the candidate, and then a brief period, usually around 30 seconds, for the candidate to prepare and formulate a response. Then, the tool will record the candidate’s response (video and audio) for the allotted time for that question, which is usually just a few minutes. There may be an option to redo the video one time without a penalty, but don’t rely on it as that is not always an option. Afterwards, the AI tool will create a report based on two main elements: facial analysis and language analysis (1).  11.1.1 Facial Analysis Facial analysis will focus on the non-verbal aspect of the interview or how you conduct yourself during the recordings. This may include things such as eye contact with the camera, eye wandering, lip position and movements, eyebrow movements (furrowing and raising), amount of smiling, chin raising, and more (2). 11.1.2 Language Analysis On the other hand, language analysis will focus on the content of your responses and the nature of your delivery. During or immediately after the recorded interview, the AI tool will convert your responses to text. Then, it’ll parse through this and look for various things. From a content perspective, this may include the technical language and vocabulary you use that aligns with the job description and what the company is looking for (1). From a delivery perspective, this may include active vs passive voice, run-on sentences, the use of filler words, and the tone of your voice. 11.2 Benefits AI-assessed interviews provide numerous benefits for both the recruiter and candidate: Recruiters Allows the company to accept more applicants to the open position  Spend less money on employees to assess the video recordings Removes the bottleneck of screening the recordings by hand Candidates While there is always a deadline, you can choose to do the recorded interview when it works best in your schedule More fair hiring process that isn’t influenced as much by preconceptions and human biases and instead focuses more on qualifications 11.3 Drawbacks While AI-assessed interviews have its benefits, there are some significant drawbacks: AI tools must be coded by humans in the first place, so there is no guarantee that the tool will be free of human biases They may reinforce discriminatory practices such as penalizing someone with a strong accent or speed impediment Human emotions and facial expressions are very complex and may not be interpreted correctly, which can inadvertently remove a qualified candidate from the selection process Concerns regarding personal privacy and data security due to the large amounts of information being collected during the recordings 11.4 What You (A Student) Can Do! As a student preparing for the recruiting process this upcoming school year, you may be wondering how you can best set yourself up for success if you ever experience one of these AI interviews. Look no further! The following subsections highlight some tips and best practices. 11.4.1 General Preparation General preparation relates to activities and preparation work you should be doing prior to the interview to ensure you’re best prepared to answer the questions. Research the company and general job type thoroughly in case of any questions related to why you want to work for the company or why you are applying to that positions Prepare what you are going to say. Research some commonly asked interview questions and make sure you have a story bank of your past experiences that you can pull from and adjust based on the question asked Practice using the STAR (situation, task, action, result) method as it’s very popular framework for providing a response that is coherent, comprehensive, and insightful 11.4.2 Countering the AI Tools Countering the AI tools relates to what you should do during the interview based on what the AI tools are looking for and analyzing. Practice talking to a camera and recording yourself so you get a good feel for where you’re at and how to make progress (see Chapter 6: Student Practice Interviews) Dress nice as if you were being interviewed by an actual interviewer in person Clean the background of your recording space so the AI tool doesn’t penalize you for a distracting background or make it harder for it to more accurately read your facial expressions Ensure your lighting is good to allow for a proper facial analysis by the AI Try to maintain eye contact with the camera as much as possible and use sticky notes on the computer/laptop if you want to refer to material Keep your head high or at a neutral position; avoid angling your head downward Smile and maintain a happy facial expression Avoid the use of filler words like “um”, “like”, or “hmm” Use keywords (skills and job duties) from the job description during your responses if you can Speak clearly and loudly (more than usual) to ensure the AI tool can translate your verbal response into text Try not to furrow your eyebrows as it can be interpreted as confusion, disapproval, or worry "],["skill-assessments.html", "Chapter 12 Skill Assessments", " Chapter 12 Skill Assessments "],["predicting-candidates-success.html", "Chapter 13 Predicting Candidates’ Success 13.1 Personality and Trait Assessments 13.2 Predictive Models for Roles 13.3 Behavior Analysis 13.4 What You (A Student) Can Do!", " Chapter 13 Predicting Candidates’ Success While the ideal job position is a two-way street in which the candidate wants the company and the company wants the candidate, ultimately, the company wants to know how you will perform and help it improve its overall performance. One way to do this is to use AI tools that can predict the success you may have in the role and how you conduct yourself. The following subsections describe exactly what this is and how it works. 13.1 Personality and Trait Assessments One way that recruiters may predict candidates’ success in a role is by better understanding their personality traits. Recruiters can now leverage AI tools to assess these personality traits. Ultimately, they want to know how you may interact with other people and what you may do in various situations. 13.1.1 Zelfium Zelfium distills 300+ scientifically verified personality factors into 7 major traits, 14 sub-traits, and 36 components using machine learning, particularly neural deep networks. Zelfium’s innovation lies in its use of AI to analyze user responses and behaviors, resulting in a highly accurate personality profile. This dynamic process continuously refines results, offering a comprehensive understanding of human personalities worldwide. 13.2 Predictive Models for Roles Organizations can leverage their historical data to build predictive models for specific roles, which are often trained by AI algorithms that pull from previous or current employees at the company who have been successful. This can then be used in assessing potential candidates in the future. 13.2.1 Affinix Affinix by PeopleScout is an innovative AI sourcing tool driven by predictive analytics technology. It assists employers in identifying success-predicting qualities and swiftly locating candidates who align with these traits across various platforms. The tool’s predictive capabilities improve over time as recruiters input more data, culminating in refined candidate predictions. This ensures that AffinixTM maximizes its predictive analytics potential and enhances the efficiency of talent acquisition. 13.3 Behavior Analysis Similar to personality and trait assessments, companies may use AI tools to predict the behavior of candidates in a working environment and how that may impact their ability to succeed in a specific role. 13.3.1 The PI Behavioral Assessment The PI Behavioral Assessment is an advanced AI tool that goes beyond traditional personality tests. It quickly uncovers an individual’s natural behavioral drives and needs, helping predict their actions in various situations. By answering two questions about expected work behavior and self-perceived behavior, participants are assigned one of 17 Reference Profiles, offering insights into their innate tendencies. The assessment measures four key behavioral drives: dominance, which influences control; extroversion, driving social interaction; patience, seeking stability; and formality, promoting rule conformity. This tool empowers organizations to make informed hiring and team-building decisions, enhancing workplace dynamics and performance. 13.4 What You (A Student) Can Do! Use assessment results to pinpoint areas for improvement, and dedicate time to refine these skills and behaviors through online courses, workshops, and self-study. Strengthening your abilities will position you as a competitive candidate in job applications and promotions. Leverage behavioral assessments and personality questionnaires to gain deeper insights into your strengths, weaknesses, and behavioral traits. Armed with this self-awareness, tailor your career path to match your attributes and work on any areas that could be holding you back. Tap into predictive analytics tools to stay attuned to shifting job market trends and the skills in demand. Use this foresight to adjust your educational path, ensuring it aligns with these trends. If you’re already employed, identify opportunities for upskilling or reskilling to remain valuable in your role or when pursuing new avenues. Take your time when completing these and answer questions thoughtfully. You want recruiters to have an accurate representation of who you are as a person and how you can contribute to their company. Don’t stress too much about this part of the recruiting process (if it exists at the company you are applying to). Be confident in who you are as a person and what you bring to the table.
