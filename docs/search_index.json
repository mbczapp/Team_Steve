Ross School of Business, the primary goal by graduation is to have a full-time job offer at a company and location that makes them excited to start their professional careers. Throughout the fall and winter semesters, recruiting is an incredibly time-consuming and stressful process, so students must use their time and effort efficiently to maximize their job opportunities. However, the recent and rapid progression of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has reshaped the recruiting landscape. Therefore, students need to understand how they can use these tools to their advantage and how recruiters may be using AI throughout the recruitment process. Our book will provide a comprehensive overview of these AI tools. We will approach this from two perspectives: students’ and recruiters’. For students, we discuss how they can use AI job finders, resume and cover letter optimization, practice interviews, and automated applications to support their professional endeavors. On the other hand, we discuss what AI tools recruiters may use, like applicant tracking systems (ATS), resume and cover letter screening, interview assessments, skill assessments, and predictive analytics. Then, we suggest how students should tailor their presentation of themselves to fit what these AI tools are looking for. Students looking for AI tools to help their application and interview process should see Chapters 4 - 7 Students looking for a better understanding of how recruiters use AI tools should see Chapters 8 - 13 "],["about-us.html", "Chapter 2 About Us 2.1 Jingyi Wang 2.2 Kuigang Zhang 2.3 Michael Czapp 2.4 Xinqian Dai 2.5 Yousuf Altameemi", " Chapter 2 About Us Our team, Team Steve, is driven by Steve’s desire for a website that describes how new AI Tools are used in the recruitment process.

Generative AI techniques have also shown significant progress in generating realistic text, images, music, and other media. AI programming revolves around cognitive skills that encompass: 1. Learning: The acquisition of data and creation of algorithms that convert it into actionable information, providing step-by-step instructions for specific tasks to computing devices. 2. Reasoning: The selection of appropriate algorithms to achieve desired outcomes. 3. Self-correction: Continuously refining algorithms to ensure optimal and precise results. 4. Creativity: Utilizing neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods, and other AI techniques to generate novel images, text, music, and ideas. The significance of artificial intelligence lies in its potential to revolutionize how we live, work, and engage in leisure activities. AI has found effective applications in automating tasks traditionally performed by humans, such as customer service, lead generation, fraud detection, and quality control. Particularly in repetitive and detail-oriented tasks, AI often outperforms humans in terms of speed and accuracy, as demonstrated in analyzing vast numbers of legal documents for accurate field completion. The processing capabilities of AI enable enterprises to gain valuable insights into their operations that were previously inaccessible. The proliferation of AI tools, especially generative AI, promises transformative impacts across various domains, including education, marketing, and product design. Leading companies like Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta have integrated AI technologies to enhance their operations and maintain a competitive edge. For instance, Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, employs AI at the core of its search engine, Waymo’s self-driving cars, and Google Brain, the pioneer behind the transformer neural network architecture that drives recent advancements in natural language processing. Overall, the advent of AI not only drives efficiency improvements but also creates unprecedented business opportunities, as evidenced by Uber’s success in leveraging computer software to connect riders with taxis and becoming a Fortune 500 company. The ongoing progress in AI holds the potential to shape a dynamic and transformative future across various industries.

More commonly, though, the video interview assessment that an AI conducts will be through a self-recorded interview the candidate will record on the employer’s hiring platform. Watch the following video for a concise summary of how AI can be used in the interview process! The AI Video Interview 11.1 How it Works It’s important to note that the extent or amount of influence an AI tool will have will vary on the company. One company may not use AI tools at all to analyze a recorded interview video, whereas another company may use AI as a supplemental analysis to support decision making or just rely entirely on AI to filter out candidates. In general, a video interview assessment entails a question being shown to the candidate, and then a brief period, usually around 30 seconds, for the candidate to prepare and formulate a response. Then, the tool will record the candidate’s response (video and audio) for the allotted time for that question, which is usually just a few minutes. There may be an option to redo the video one time without a penalty, but don’t rely on it as that is not always an option. Afterwards, the AI tool will create a report based on two main elements: facial analysis and language analysis (1).  11.1.1 Facial Analysis Facial analysis will focus on the non-verbal aspect of the interview or how you conduct yourself during the recordings. This may include things such as eye contact with the camera, eye wandering, lip position and movements, eyebrow movements (furrowing and raising), amount of smiling, chin raising, and more (2). 11.1.2 Language Analysis On the other hand, language analysis will focus on the content of your responses and the nature of your delivery. During or immediately after the recorded interview, the AI tool will convert your responses to text. Then, it’ll parse through this and look for various things. From a content perspective, this may include the technical language and vocabulary you use that aligns with the job description and what the company is looking for (1). From a delivery perspective, this may include active vs passive voice, run-on sentences, the use of filler words, and the tone of your voice. 11.2 Benefits AI-assessed interviews provide numerous benefits for both the recruiter and candidate: Recruiters Allows the company to accept more applicants to the open position  Spend less money on employees to assess the video recordings Removes the bottleneck of screening the recordings by hand Candidates While there is always a deadline, you can choose to do the recorded interview when it works best in your schedule More fair hiring process that isn’t influenced as much by preconceptions and human biases and instead focuses more on qualifications 11.3 Drawbacks While AI-assessed interviews have its benefits, there are some significant drawbacks: AI tools must be coded by humans in the first place, so there is no guarantee that the tool will be free of human biases They may reinforce discriminatory practices such as penalizing someone with a strong accent or speed impediment Human emotions and facial expressions are very complex and may not be interpreted correctly, which can inadvertently remove a qualified candidate from the selection process Concerns regarding personal privacy and data security due to the large amounts of information being collected during the recordings 11.4 What You (A Student) Can Do! As a student preparing for the recruiting process this upcoming school year, you may be wondering how you can best set yourself up for success if you ever experience one of these AI interviews. Look no further! The following subsections highlight some tips and best practices. 11.4.1 General Preparation General preparation relates to activities and preparation work you should be doing prior to the interview to ensure you’re best prepared to answer the questions. Research the company and general job type thoroughly in case of any questions related to why you want to work for the company or why you are applying to that positions Prepare what you are going to say. Research some commonly asked interview questions and make sure you have a story bank of your past experiences that you can pull from and adjust based on the question asked Practice using the STAR (situation, task, action, result) method as it’s very popular framework for providing a response that is coherent, comprehensive, and insightful 11.4.2 Countering the AI Tools Countering the AI tools relates to what you should do during the interview based on what the AI tools are looking for and analyzing. Practice talking to a camera and recording yourself so you get a good feel for where you’re at and how to make progress (see Chapter 6: Student Practice Interviews) Dress as if you were being interviewed by an actual interviewer in person Clean the background of your recording space so the AI tool doesn’t penalize you for a distracting background or make it harder for it to more accurately read your facial expressions Ensure your lighting is good to allow for a proper facial analysis by the AI Try to maintain eye contact with the camera as much as possible and use sticky notes on the computer/laptop if you want to refer to material Keep your head high or at a neutral position; avoid angling your head downward Smile and maintain a happy facial expression Avoid the use of filler words like “um”, “like”, or “hmm” Use keywords (skills and job duties) from the job description during your responses if you can Speak clearly and loudly (more than usual) to ensure the AI tool can translate your verbal response into text Try not to furrow your eyebrows as it can be interpreted as confusion, disapproval, or worry "],["skill-assessments.html", "Chapter 12 Skill Assessments", " Chapter 12 Skill Assessments "],["predicting-candidates-success.html", "Chapter 13 Predicting Candidates’ Success", " Chapter 13 Predicting Candidates’ Success "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 14 Conclusion", " Chapter 14 Conclusion "],["our-working-process.html", "Chapter 15 Our Working Process", " Chapter 15 Our Working Process "],["references.html", "Chapter 16 References 16.1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 16.2 AI Tools for Job Searching 16.3 Resume and Cover Letter Optimizer 16.4 Student Practice Interviews 16.5 Automated Applications 16.6 What are Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)? 16.7 Recruiting Chatbots 16.8 Resume and Cover Letter Screening 16.9 Video Interview Assessments 16.10 Skill Assessments 16.11 Predicting Candidates’ Success", " Chapter 16 References 16.1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence?Offer=abt_pubpro_AI-Insider 16.2 AI Tools for Job Searching 16.3 Resume and Cover Letter Optimizer 16.4 Student Practice Interviews https://app.yoodli.ai/blog/the-top-ai-tools-for-interview-preparation-in-2023 16.5 Automated Applications 16.6 What are Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)? https://medium.com/swlh/90-of-fortune-500-companies-use-an-applicant-tracking-system-whats-it-5a6b6d25e5e7 16.7 Recruiting Chatbots 16.8 Resume and Cover Letter Screening 16.9 Video Interview Assessments https://www.hubert.ai/insights/what-are-ai-interviews\\ https://theconversation.com/facial-analysis-ai-is-being-used-in-job-interviews-it-will-probably-reinforce-inequality-124790 16.10 Skill Assessments 16.11 Predicting Candidates’ Success "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
