<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>My name is Michael Czapp, and I am currently a Master of Business Analytics (MBAn) student at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. In April 2023, I graduated from the College of Engineering here with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering.

It also allowed me to have an extra year at the University of Michigan and stay in my home state, and I plan to make the most of it!</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<p>My experience primarily consists of two summer internships. In 2021, I interned at DTE Energy in Detroit, MI as a Continuous Improvement Intern. I got to develop Power BI dashboards, lead a time study analysis on claim investigations, and support the execution of a pilot study at one of the company’s sites. In 2022, I interned at Boston Scientific Corporation as a Global Supply Chain Consulting Intern, which was essentially an internal consulting role. I built automations, helped plan a global virtual conference, and used Excel to identify opportunities to decrease shipping costs to customers, all of which provided me with great experience in using data to discover meaningful insights to share with stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Hello! My name is Xinqian (Demi) Dai, and I come from the beautiful province of Heilongjiang, China, where I was born and raised. In 2019, I embarked on my exciting journey by enrolling at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for my undergraduate studies. I graduated with a double major in Marketing and Statistics in May 2023. My interest in Marketing has deep roots that extend back to my childhood days when I found myself more fascinated by the commercial inserts of a washing powder than the animated series on TV.  Currently, I am intrigued by Customer Analytics, Advertising Effectiveness, and Digital Marketing, and I’m eager to delve deeper into these areas. Looking ahead, my post-graduation aspirations involve entering into the MarTech (Marketing Technology) industry. Armed with the knowledge and skills from the MBAn program, I aim to make a significant impact by applying data-driven strategies and innovative marketing technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<p>During my time at UMass Amherst, I engaged in a diverse range of research experiences and marketing projects. As a Marketing Research Assistant at the UMass Ombuds Office, I analyzed data from over 300 undergraduate student visitors, studying variables like gender and major to identify successful conflict resolution strategies. Utilizing R and Python, I applied regression models to estimate meeting times and understand the impact of visitor demographics on appointment durations. During my participation in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program, I conducted full-time research on Bayesian parameter estimations, highlighting the effectiveness of Bayesian models over traditional linear regression models. Additionally, as a Research Assistant in the UMass Marketing Department, I analyzed customer reactions to visual advertisements for various product categories and conducted experiments to evaluate the effect of different headbands on students. As a Strategist for the UMass AdLab, I designed customized questionnaires and implemented successful advertising strategies, resulting in a significant increase in orders for local companies. These experiences have shaped my passion for business analytics and my dedication to data-driven research and strategic planning.</p>
