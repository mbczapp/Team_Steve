<p>Our team, <strong>Team Steve</strong>, is driven by Steve’s desire for a website that describes how new AI Tools are used in the recruitment process. For context, Steve (as seen in the black O’Neill shirt in the front left) is a student here at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business who is NOT in our project team. When deciding our team name, we thought it’d be a great idea to name it after the first person we encounter. We happened to run into Steve outside of our classroom, and the rest is history.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jingyi (Vera) Wang, currently a Master of Business Analytics student at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. In May 2023, I graduated from Boston University with a concentration in Finance and Business Analytics. From my previous academic and internship experiences, I found my passion for business analytics. That’s the reason why I decided to pursue a graduate degree in order to help me specialize in my area of interest and enrich my experience and knowledge in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<p>My experience is mainly composed of internships, projects, and case competitions. In 2021, I interned at Accenture as a management consulting intern. I managed project plans, conducted data analysis, and facilitated platform testing sessions for clients to improve the efficiency and accuracy of their online platform. In 2022, I interned at Vantage House Media as a finance intern. I generated comprehensive financial reports and provided stakeholders with valuable recommendations and potential VC prospects based on data analysis. In addition, I was a quantitative financial analyst intern at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities, where I built python models to select top-performing stocks and assess fund managers’ performance. </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>My name is Kuigang Zhang, and I go by KG. I graduated from UCLA with a Data Science major and an Accounting minor in June 2023.

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>My name is Michael Czapp, and I am currently a Master of Business Analytics (MBAn) student at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. In April 2023, I graduated from the College of Engineering here with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering. I knew I wanted to specialize in analytics, so starting a graduate program right after graduation made the most sense. It also allowed me to have an extra year at the University of Michigan and stay in my home state, and I plan to make the most of it!</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<p>My experience primarily consists of two summer internships. In 2021, I interned at DTE Energy in Detroit, MI as a Continuous Improvement Intern. I got to develop Power BI dashboards, lead a time study analysis on claim investigations, and support the execution of a pilot study at one of the company’s sites. In 2022, I interned at Boston Scientific Corporation as a Global Supply Chain Consulting Intern, which was essentially an internal consulting role. I built automations, helped plan a global virtual conference, and used Excel to identify opportunities to decrease shipping costs to customers, all of which provided me with great experience in using data to discover meaningful insights to share with stakeholders.</p>

<p><img src="Demi%20Photo.png" width="200" /></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Hello! My name is Xinqian (Demi) Dai, and I come from the beautiful province of Heilongjiang, China, where I was born and raised. In 2019, I embarked on my exciting journey by enrolling at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for my undergraduate studies. I graduated with a double major in Marketing and Statistics in May 2023. My interest in Marketing has deep roots that extend back to my childhood days when I found myself more fascinated by the commercial inserts of a washing powder than the animated series on TV.  Currently, I am intrigued by Customer Analytics, Advertising Effectiveness, and Digital Marketing, and I’m eager to delve deeper into these areas. Looking ahead, my post-graduation aspirations involve entering into the MarTech (Marketing Technology) industry. Armed with the knowledge and skills from the MBAn program, I aim to make a significant impact by applying data-driven strategies and innovative marketing technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<p>During my time at UMass Amherst, I engaged in a diverse range of research experiences and marketing projects. As a Marketing Research Assistant at the UMass Ombuds Office, I analyzed data from over 300 undergraduate student visitors, studying variables like gender and major to identify successful conflict resolution strategies. Utilizing R and Python, I applied regression models to estimate meeting times and understand the impact of visitor demographics on appointment durations. During my participation in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program, I conducted full-time research on Bayesian parameter estimations, highlighting the effectiveness of Bayesian models over traditional linear regression models. Additionally, as a Research Assistant in the UMass Marketing Department, I analyzed customer reactions to visual advertisements for various product categories and conducted experiments to evaluate the effect of different headbands on students. As a Strategist for the UMass AdLab, I designed customized questionnaires and implemented successful advertising strategies, resulting in a significant increase in orders for local companies. These experiences have shaped my passion for business analytics and my dedication to data-driven research and strategic planning.</p>
