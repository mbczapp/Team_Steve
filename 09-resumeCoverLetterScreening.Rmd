## What You (A Student) Can Do!

Understanding what tools recruiters use to filter our candidates is the first step. By understanding the most popular tools, a few of which are referenced above, you can try to adjust your resume and cover letters to match what these tools search for and filter on. There are additional [recommended best practices](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/resume-ai#:~:text=Instead%20of%20using%20a%20visual,this%20kind%20of%20complex%20information.) you can follow to ensure this step of the recruitment process is not where you fall out of the race with the company of your dreams:

-   Triple check (or even quadruple check!) that there are **no typos or mispelled words**. It\'s much easier for an AI tool to discover these errors than a human

-   Use a **traditional, standard, and clean** resume format

-   Make sure to **submit the correct file type** for your resume (usually specified in the job application) as some AI tools can only process certain file types

-   Avoid using a visual resume, especially for technical roles. Opt for **plain text and relatively basic formatting**

-   Make a thorough attempt to **add keywords** to your resume that were mentioned in the job posting as the AI tool will look for these

-   Include a **mix of hard and soft skills** to showcase your diverse skill set

-   **Traditional or usual resume advice still applies** to the resumes you submit to be analyzed by AI tools
