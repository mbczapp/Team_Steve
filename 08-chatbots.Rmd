## What You (A Student) Can Do!

For a student to successfully navigate and benefit from recruiting chatbots during their job search, they should consider the following strategies:

-   **Familiarize with the common platforms and tools and algorithms** that companies use. This knowledge can help anticipate what to expect and how to interact with recruiting chatbots.
-   When interacting with chatbots, **use clear language and be specific in your queries**. Avoid slang, abbreviations, or overly complex vocabulary since chatbots operate best with straightforward information.
-   Chatbots are programmed to screen candidates based on predefined criteria. Anticipate and **prepare for standard questions** related to qualifications, experience, and job preferences.
-   Make sure your **resume or online profile highlights your main qualifications, skills, and achievements** in a clear and organized manner. This helps the chatbot easily identify and match your profile with suitable roles.
-   Given the 24/7 availability of chatbots, take advantage of this by **actively engaging with them**, asking questions, and seeking information about job roles, company culture, or application processes.
-   If you feel the chatbot isn't adequately addressing your concerns or if you have specific questions, **ask for human intervention or look for alternative communication channels**.
-   While engaging with chatbots, **be wary of sharing overly personal or sensitive information** unless you're sure of the platform's privacy standards.
-   Some advanced chatbots offer the option to **provide feedback**. Utilize this to clarify misunderstandings or to improve future interactions.
-   While chatbots are a valuable tool, **don't rely solely on them**. Use additional resources, such as career counselors, networking events, and traditional job platforms to complement your job search.
